# In order to maintain an authenticated session with logind and to prevent
# bypassing the screen locker by switching terminals, Xorg has to be started on
# the same virtual terminal where the login occurred.[1] Therefore it is
# recommended to specify vt$XDG_VTNR:
exec /usr/bin/X -nolisten tcp "$@" vt$XDG_VTNR
